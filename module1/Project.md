# Project 1

## Base Level
In the base level of this project, learners will create a simplified simulation of an autonomous vehicle's basic control system that can follow a straight path. The virtual car will receive inputs such as distance to objects and vehicle speed and will output basic commands like throttle and brake. The program will handle real-time data updates and adjust the car's behavior accordingly. This level will cover the fundamental C++ concepts in the first three units, version control, and collaboration using GitHub.

## Reach Level
At the reach level, learners will enhance the virtual car program by incorporating additional maneuvers like steering and path following oncurved roads. They will receive inputs such as road curvature and will process this information to output steering angles. Students will also implement basic obstacle detection and avoidance strategies. This level will encourage students to dive deeper into C++ concepts and apply them more extensively in the development of their program.

## Expert Level
This level will challenge learners to create a more advanced autonomous vehicle simulation. They will integrate multiple sensor inputs, such as LIDAR and camera data, to build a more comprehensive understanding of the car's environment. They will develop more advanced control algorithms, considering traffic rules and real-world constraints, and incorporate more rigorous error handling and debugging techniques to ensure the smooth operation of the virtual car.
